# How to Run
Follow these steps to immerse yourself into Generative AI Storytelling

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/athul-2003/Imagery-Storyteller.git
   cd Imagery-Storyteller
   ```
2. **Create a new virtual environment**
   
   Create a new virtual environment in the same folder and activate that environment:
   
   If Anaconda or Miniconda is installed:
   ```bash
      conda create -p venv python==3.10
      conda activate venv

   ```
   Or (For Windows )
   ```bash
      python -m venv myenv
      .\myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run vision.py
   ```

That's it , now be ready to embark on an enchanting journey into the realm of creativity with the power of Gemini-pro and generative AI.
